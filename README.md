ðŸ“‚ File Structure

New Data â†’ Contains fresh/raw sales performance data with columns:
Country, Product, Units Sold, Revenue, Cost, Profit, Date.

Data â†’ Similar to New Data but likely your cleaned dataset, structured for analysis.

PIVOT TABLES â†’ Contains summary tables (pivot tables) showing performance breakdowns, e.g.:

Profit by Product & Country

Grand Totals across regions

DASHBOARD â†’ Appears mostly empty here in raw view (Excel dashboards often rely on visuals, charts, slicers, and formatting not visible when read programmatically). In Excel itself, this is your interactive dashboard.
